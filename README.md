# I made this Excel spreadsheet to help me keep track of profits on a game call Hay Day when there are special events.
# This spreadsheet could also be used for businesses in terms of finance, to have a simple spreadsheet of stock. 
# This was my first time coding something big, I do not do much coding and am very happy with the results.
# This file is free to use and I hope you enjoy using it. :)
