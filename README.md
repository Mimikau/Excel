# I made this Excel spreadsheet to help me keep track of profits on a game call Hay Day when there are special events.
# This spreadsheet could also be used for businesses in terms of finance, to have a simple spreadsheet of stock. 
# I have made the user interface very easy to use and have cut as many shortcuts for the user as possible.
# On this, you can record data and put the prices you cought products for, which will automatically be placed where the information is needed.
# You can also generate any graph you want for products with the press of a button.
# This was my first time coding something big, I do not do much coding and am very happy with the results.
# This file is free to use and I hope you enjoy using it. :)
